# BoundarySPH - BACKUP [May 18, 2024]

This backup corresponds to the latest developer version of BoundarySPH that matches The MDPI Algorithms manuscript **"Boundary SPH for Robust Particle--Mesh Interaction in Three Dimensions"**.

* Online Manuscript: [https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/17/5/218](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/17/5/218)

This backup version contains the following that might be removed in subsequent versions of the repository:

* All debug scenes - these contain deprecated components and code.
* Anything that corresponds to Xi's work - I want to remove any old evidence of Xi's stuff on this. The git history will still be there, so it's not like everything's lost.
* Anything related to boids, continuous flows, or pressure renderers

This backup maintains all these older components, in case they are needed in the future.
